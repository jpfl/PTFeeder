Please follow our installation guides to make PT Feeder run on your system. Be aware that PT-Feeder is not a playful Utility with colorful buttons and a shiny UI. It is a power tool, that works nearly completely from the command line. Make sure you are safe enough to handle your operating system good enough and that you are able to edit configuration text files without breaking them.

## Important: Test before running PT

PT-Feeder does generate your Profit-Trailer configuration files for you. It overwrites your own PAIRS.properties, DCA.properties and INDICATOR.properties in your PT trading folder. Please make sure you run PTF once before stating PT and look at those files generated. Only start Profit Trailer if you are sure that config is how you want it to be.
